# purpose
To use this script to replace the stand up reminders in Ticktick.
	I don't want to enable Ticktick's notification function on Yvonne. It's too annoying when both Yvone and the cell notificate soemthing.
	Only the notification on cell is easy to be overlooked.

# changelog
2024-0205-1216 Added title to the MsgBox and modified the text.
2024-0204-1504 Used Goto and Sleep rather then SetTimer.
